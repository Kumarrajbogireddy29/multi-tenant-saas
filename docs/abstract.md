# Abstract

The Multi-Tenant SaaS Platform is a web-based application designed to support multiple organizations within a single system while maintaining data isolation and security. Each tenant can access the platform independently without affecting other tenants.

The system uses a centralized backend with tenant-based authentication and authorization. A React frontend provides user interaction, while a Node.js backend handles business logic and database communication. Docker is used to containerize the application for easy deployment and scalability.
